**Secure - Local Security App Prototype**

Welcome to the Secure Kelowna GitHub repository! This repository showcases a prototype for a local security app developed using Android Studio as part of a team project. Our team of three focused on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface aimed at enhancing community safety.

**🛠️ Project Overview**
Secure Kelowna is a conceptual app designed to empower local communities by providing tools to share and respond to security concerns in their area. Though the functionality is primarily a prototype, the app interface offers several features, including an alert system, an interactive map, emergency contact management, and a community forum.

The app leverages the Google Maps API to display real-time locations of potential dangers and other alerts. This was a critical feature to simulate how users could visualize and respond to threats in their surroundings.

**🌟 Features**
**1. Create an Alert:**
Draft and publish alerts to notify other users of potential dangers.
While this feature is not connected to a real backend, the UI simulates how users would interact with the app.

**2. Community Forum:**
View a collection of alerts and discussions posted by other users.
This forum is a prototype to show how a community-driven safety network might function.
Location Sharing:

**3. Emergency contacts by inputting their name and phone number.**
Store emergency contacts and choose whether or not to share your location with them via email

**4. Alert Map:**
View an interactive map showing the locations of reported dangers.
Powered by the Google Maps API, this feature highlights the potential for visualizing alerts geographically.

**🧩 Technical Details**
Framework: Android Studio (Java/Kotlin)
Key API Used: Google Maps API for geolocation and map integration.
Focus: UI/UX design and interface development (functionality is not connected to a backend).
